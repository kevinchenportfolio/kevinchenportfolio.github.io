<p>As a <strong>TF-20</strong> (20-hour/week Teaching Fellow), I support undergraduate instruction in one of Yale Jackson's flagship policy seminars taught by Prof. Edward Wittenstein. The class examines the history, practice, and future of U.S. intelligence and its relationship to national security decision-making.</p>

<p>In my role, I lead weekly discussion sections, mentor students on writing and research assignments, and help develop teaching materials. I also bring insights from my prior experience in the U.S. intelligence community to deepen classroom engagement around topics such as covert action, and analysis tradecraft.</p>
