<p>Hi, I‚Äôm <strong>Kevin Chen</strong>. I am currently a Yale MPP student set to graduate in 2027. My interests and goals as a data scientist and policy analyst sit at the intersection of <strong>AI governance</strong>, <strong>U.S.‚ÄìChina relations</strong>, and <strong>emerging tech regulation</strong>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm passionate about shaping how the U.S. engages with artificial intelligence in national security, and I bring experience in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Developing AI/ML tools for government decision-making</li>
  <li>Analyzing geopolitical trends in East Asia</li>
  <li>Communicating technical insights to senior policymakers</li>
</ul>

# Early Career

After graduating from Dartmouth with a BA in Quantitative Social Science, I worked as a data analyst for the FBI doing resource analysis from 2022‚Äì2023. I then worked at the CIA from 2023‚Äì2025 as a data scientist. These jobs exposed me to working with specialists across different industries and taught me how to present highly technical work to executive leadership. It was a fascinating career path, which taught me a lot about how national security works and brought me to many cool places, but I ultimately realized that I wanted to do something different in the future. Something less hands-on-keyboard, but still interfacing with the data science realm. I am now at Yale trying to chart a new path toward a tech policy pivot while honing my technical skills.

# Activities

In my free time, I try to work on side projects that can keep my skills sharp:

- Do pet projects involving AI speech to text (Whisper, Nemo, Canary, etc)  
- Work on my educational YouTube channel, [Roman Dodecahedron](https://www.youtube.com/@RomanDodecahedron)  
- Contribute to open-source AI/ML projects how I can and volunteer  
- Rigorous upkeep with language study, namely Chinese and Russian

# Random Facts

- Have an 11.08 K/D in Fortnite, which puts me in the top 0.1% of players ‚Äî [View stats](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/all/PalantirGaming)  
- Love exploring the US. I've been across New England, the Southwest, Alaska, Yellowstone, and many others  
- Irvine Welsh is my favorite author. *Trainspotting* is one of the best and most raw works of fiction I've read.
- I have been a finalist in Jeopardy auditions 4 separate times now. 5th times the charm?
