Hello Medium world, and welcome to my humble first post. I’m writing this fresh from my Alaskan quarter-life crisis (and I’ll probably have the flu soon having endured a coughing baby on my flight back). My name is Kevin Chen, and I am finally taking that plunge to start getting my thoughts to the world. What type of musings? Honestly, I’m still trying to figure that out. Though I figure starting off with AI and world events (especially with how calamitous current times are) aren’t bad as a total neophyte to writing.

**Who even are you?**

I come from primarily a data science background, having graduated from Dartmouth in 2022 and working in data science roles since then. However, I’ve been sort of indoctrinated into the world of geopolitics for what seems like forever. One of my first baby pictures is me slamming my hands into my dad’s beige box as a baby as it hummed Civ III. It also doesn’t help growing up into a very Taiwanese family, who is very much in tune with the bellicose posturing that China harangues my heritage with. I’m now going to Yale for my Master’s in Public Policy, a rather interesting but not unexpected pivot from my data scientist career.

Working in the federal government got me to really expand my interest in geopolitics, and how data science can be applied in that realm. I wanted to really nurture my skills in policy analysis, particularly in East Asian affairs so grad school seemed like the best choice for me. I start at Yale this fall, but so far the professors and cohort I’ve met have validated my positive thoughts. It’ll be interesting writing my political ramblings having worked under the Biden and Trump administrations (and as you can infer from my ex-fed status, my preferences…)

**What to expect/special thanks**

I’m hoping for weekly uploads on topics in data science, geopolitics, or my political thoughts reminiscing about my time in D.C. every Sunday or so. Though juggling my laziness + studying for the LSAT we’ll see if I adhere to this. I’m honestly amazed I even crossed the gap writing this intro article in the first place, but I already feel so fulfilled. So if you are in that same boat, as trite as it sounds just do it! A big thanks to my sister who is a very established writer and travel author in her own right, and my good friend Nick for inspiring me to begin this and for tolerating my naive third-wayisms.
